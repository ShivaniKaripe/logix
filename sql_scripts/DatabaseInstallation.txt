== Installing Logix 7.3.1 databases ==


This document assumes you will use SQL Server Authentication using the standard
Copient_Logix user. For information on using Windows Authentication with Logix,
please consult your NCR representative.


LogixRT
-------
To install or update the LogixRT Database: 

If it does not already exist, on your SQL Server instance create a new database 
named 'LogixRT'.

Ensure that the LogixRT database has the Copient_Logix_uspRole role defined, 
and that Copient_Logix is a member of that role. If not, run the SQL below to 
create the role and add Copient_Logix as a member.

        sp_addrole 'Copient_Logix_uspRole'
        GO
        sp_addrolemember 'Copient_Logix_uspRole', 'Copient_Logix'
        GO

Ensure that Copient_Logix has db_owner permission on the LogixRT database.

In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), select your LogixRT database and run 
the following scripts in the given order

    LogixRTUpgrade.sql* (if present)
    LogixRT_database.sql
    LogixRTPhraseLibrary-Complete.sql
    LogixRT_Adjustments_to_base.sql (if present)

*IF THE UPGRADE SCRIPT IS INCLUDED,
DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT MORE THAN ONCE! The LogixRTUpgrade.sql script is intended 
to only be run on a database one time. It is a transitional script, to bring the 
database from a known pre-5.11.1 state to the post 5.11.1 state, after which the 
LogixRT_database.sql will bring the database to the proper current state. If the 
database it is run on is not in the expected starting state, errors will occur.



LogixXS
-------
To install or update the LogixXS Database: 

If it does not already exist, on your SQL Server instance create a new database 
named 'LogixXS'.

Ensure that the LogixXS database has the Copient_Logix_uspRole role defined, 
and that Copient_Logix is a member of that role. If not, run the SQL below to 
create the role and add Copient_Logix as a member.

        sp_addrole 'Copient_Logix_uspRole'
        GO
        sp_addrolemember 'Copient_Logix_uspRole', 'Copient_Logix'
        GO

Ensure that Copient_Logix has db_datareader and db_datawriter permissions on 
the LogixXS database.

In SSMS, select your LogixXS database, and run the following script

    LogixXSUpgrade.sql* (if present) 
    LogixXS_database.sql
    LogixXS_Adjustments_to_base.sql (if present) 

*IF THE UPGRADE SCRIPT IS INCLUDED,
DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT MORE THAN ONCE! The LogixXSUpgrade.sql script is intended 
to only be run on a database one time. It is a transitional script, to bring the 
database from a known pre-5.11.1 state to the post 5.11.1 state, after which the 
LogixXS_database.sql will bring the database to the proper current state. If the 
database it is run on is not in the expected starting state, errors will occur.

and that Copient_Logix is a member of that role. If not, run the SQL below to 
create the role and add Copient_Logix as a member.

        sp_addrole 'Copient_Logix_uspRole'
        GO
        sp_addrolemember 'Copient_Logix_uspRole', 'Copient_Logix'
        GO

Ensure that Copient_Logix has db_datareader and db_datawriter permissions on 
the LogixWH database.

LogixEX
-------

Ensure that the LogixEX database has the Copient_Logix_uspRole role defined, 
and that Copient_Logix is a member of that role. If not, run the SQL below to 
create the role and add Copient_Logix as a member.
