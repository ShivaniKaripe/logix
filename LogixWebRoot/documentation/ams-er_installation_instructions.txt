Installation instructions for the AMS-ER product

-Setting up the database
There are two system options that are associated to AMS-ER. These are found in the LogixRT database on the SystemOptions table and are option ID 114 and 115.
These queries can be run to set these system options:
--
Declare @FilePath nvarchar(255)
Declare @AutoDeleteDays nvarchar(255)
Set @FilePath = '' -- Put in the file path where you would like the report files to be stored. (Keep the single quotes)
Set @AutoDeleteDays = '' -- Put in the number of days you would like these report files and records to be kept. (Keep the single quotes)
update SystemOptions set OptionValue=@FilePath where OptionID=114;
update SystemOptions set OptionValue=@AutoDeleteDays where OptionID=115;
--
If the file path for the report file is not set, the default install path, using the environment variables, will be used.
If the deletion days are not set, reports will not be removed until manually deleted from the Logix UI.
