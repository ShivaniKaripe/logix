Database Users
______________

Logix can use one of two methods to access the database instances: Windows 
authentication, or SQL Server authentication. 



SQL Server Authentication

To use SQL Server authentication, you must create a login on the database 
server(s) named 'Copient_Logix' with the password 'App0mattox'. This is the 
user/password the Logix system will use to login to the databases by default. 

On each Logix database, a user named 'Copient_Logix' must be created, associated 
with the 'Copient_Logix' login. The Copient_Logix user must then be added to the
Copient_Logix_uspRole. 



Windows Authentication

To use Windows (Active Directory) authentication, you must first create the  
environment variable LOGIXDBACCESS with the value "ACTIVE_DIRECTORY" on your
Logix web server(s). On your SQL Servers, you must create a login for the 
Windows user your Logix web site runs as (by default '<domain>\CopientWEB'), 
and a login for the Windows user(s) your Logix Agent services run as (by 
default '<domain>\CopientSVC'). The associated users must then be created on 
each database.

The user(s) created must then be added to the Copient_Logix_uspRole.
